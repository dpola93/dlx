WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR:

5 stage classic pipeline
in order execution
2bit BTB with reconfigurable number of entries
aggressive branch/jump address calculation done in dec stage 1cc penalty for mispredictions
control unit hardwired, 13 control signals
REGFILE has 2 read ports and 1 write port
forwarding to DEC/EXE/MEM stages
stall logic on hazards and mispredictions
ALU with SHIFTER, LOGIC UNIT, ADDER, COMPARATOR, MULTIPLIER
comparator,addition and multiply operations share the same adder ( P4 adder)
multiplication is done as 16x16(truncate MSBs) in 8 cc, both signed and unsigned
SYNCHRONOUS dram,iram,regfile triggered on falling edge
support almost all RTYPE and ITYPE instructions (missing memory operations lb,lh,sb,sh)
